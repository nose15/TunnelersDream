# TunnelersDream
A tool to compute best fitting points to dig a tunnel in between in Minecraft
It takes advantage of a linear formula and finds two points within the given range between wich digging a tunnel is the easiest.
The easiness of digging a tunnel is determined by the pattern that you dig in (e.g. 2 blocks east, 3 blocks north).
If both of the values mentioned above are high, then it means that you would have to mine a lot of blocks which is not very easy and efficient.

An old project of mine, where I had no idea about the clean code and the most important code of the whole project is located in the "tunnel" function in views.py.
It is not finished but it kinda works XD.
IMO the idea was great, but the way I brought it to life back then was just disasterous. But definitely worth another shot in the future.
